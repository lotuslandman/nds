*** crontab file	
# The following is a crontab that succesfully calls the rr_notam.rb script every 3 minutes (regardless of how long it takes to return)
# the HOME line below has the ruby script called as though it is run from the specified directory (this way paths can be relative)

* todos
** change so stream is not hardcoded (currently doing stream 3 only for testing)
** put back in 4 commented out lines in delta_request.rb that is what slows down the fill of the database
** remove hardcoded /home/scott/...
** add ability to plot to see if fails to parse in delta_stream.rb
This would be the same as a request that fails validation (of xml, of aixm FNS schema)
** March 2019 is hardcoded - handle months correctly
** Sort files_to_get so the latest are parsed first
   I don't think its sorted either way now.
** BUG: filename of dates_array_from_filesystem is different from what is stored in database; should use delta_request.end_time for both
