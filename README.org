* environment
** rbenv global 2.2.2 - brings back to version of ruby used to develop application (tried 2.5 to try something out)
* git
** Working off git commit "Demo to Hoon Blue & Red Filters"
* todos
** clean up git repository
** copy over other droplets rr_notam_dod.rb to here (so I have code for both 3-minute deltas for DoD captured here as well)
** document the cron job set up for rr_notam.rb
* cron
** The following is a crontab that succesfully calls the rr_notam.rb script every 3 minutes (regardless of how long it takes to return)
