*** crontab file	
# The following is a crontab that succesfully calls the rr_notam.rb script every 3 minutes (regardless of how long it takes to return)
# the HOME line below has the ruby script called as though it is run from the specified directory (this way paths can be relative)

* environment
** version
ruby 2.5.0
rails 5.1.6
** rbenv 
rbenv global 2.5 - brings back to version of ruby used to develop application (tried ruby version 2.2.2 to try something out)
* git
 - Working from git commit "Demo to Hoon Blue & Red Filters"

 - pushed to remote master on github
* todos
** remove hardcoded /home/scott/...
** add ability to plot to see if fails to parse in delta_stream.rb
This would be the same as a request that fails validation (of xml, of aixm FNS schema)
** March 2019 is hardcoded - handle months correctly
** BUG: still getting errors in service script that fills the database.  
I still think it repeats failed requests taking up the 5 request allotment
