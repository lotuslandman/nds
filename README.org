* nds project
** description
calls delta pulls of FNS-NDS Req/Resp non-SWIM service
** rails app
*** initialization
Upon startup of rails app (server) ~/config/Applications.rb calls DeltaStream.update_database    
** ruby script
rr_notam.rb
a single execution of script collects 6 minutes of data
** cron
cron job is set up to exeucte every 3 minutes
*** crontab file	
# The following is a crontab that succesfully calls the rr_notam.rb script every 3 minutes (regardless of how long it takes to return)
# the HOME line below has the ruby script called as though it is run from the specified directory (this way paths can be relative)

* environment
** version
ruby 2.5.0
rails 5.1.6
** rbenv 
rbenv global 2.5 - brings back to version of ruby used to develop application (tried ruby version 2.2.2 to try something out)
* git
 - Working from git commit "Demo to Hoon Blue & Red Filters"

 - pushed to remote master on github
* todos
** copy over other droplets rr_notam_dod.rb to here (so I have code for both 3-minute deltas for DoD captured here as well)
** change so stream is not hardcoded (currently doing stream 3 only for testing)
** put back in 4 commented out lines in delta_request.rb that is what slows down the fill of the database
** put in ability to add dates instead of indexes of an array
** remove hardcoded /home/scott/...
** Why is delta_request_chart in so many places?  I'm trying to move it from a Notam class method to a delta_stream method 
   (so I can graph only the streams requests)
